## About

Lumin is a desktop SSH client for developers and system administrators. Built with Go-native concurrency + WebSocket + xterm.js, it delivers sub-millisecond terminal responsiveness. Packed with system resource probes, remote file manager, command history, cloud-synced encrypted backups, and AI agent (MCP) integration — no server-side agent required.

## Features

### Terminal & Connection
- **Async PTY Engine** — Go-native concurrent I/O on the backend, WebSocket + xterm.js for ultra-low latency
- **Predictive Local Echo** — Buttery-smooth typing even on high-latency connections
- **Multi-Terminal Tabs** — Open multiple terminal tabs within a single SSH session, each independently closable
- **Session Management** — Manage multiple SSH sessions simultaneously; right-click tab context menu (disconnect / close / reconnect)
- **Sensitive Info Toggle** — One-click hide/show passwords, private keys

### Dashboard & Quick Connect
- **Quick Connect** — Enter host, port, user, password/key and connect instantly — no pre-configuration needed
- **Grid/Table Views** — Toggle between card grid and table layout
- **Search & Filter** — Real-time search by server name, host, tags
- **Smart Latency Detection** — **SSH Banner RTT** (proxy-aware, recommended with Clash/V2Ray) and **TCP Dial** protocols
- **Configurable Ping Interval** — Auto-refresh interval for latency checks
- **Tab Overflow Dropdown** — Excess server tabs collapse into a searchable dropdown list

### Server Management
- **Auto-Save** — Quick-connected servers are automatically saved after successful connection
- **Clone Server** — Right-click to clone any server with all configuration (passwords, keys included)

## Configuration & Data

### Data Storage Location

On first run, Lumin creates `Lumin/config/` under the user config directory:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Lumin\config\` |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Lumin/config/` |
| Linux | `~/.config/Lumin/config/` |

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `lumin.key` | 32-byte AES encryption key (auto-generated on first run) |
| `connections.json` | Server connection configs (passwords/keys AES-GCM encrypted) |
| `credentials.json` | Centralized credential data |
| `webdav.json` | WebDAV / R2 / FTP / SFTP sync config |
| `quick_commands.json` | Quick command library |
| `param_history.json` | Dynamic parameter history |
| `history/` | Per-server command history |
| `sync_mode.json` | Auto-sync mode configuration |
| `last_sync_time` | Last sync timestamp |
| `snapshot_time` | Snapshot timestamp |
| `ai_global_settings.json` | AI global settings (provider selection, auto-approve, slash commands, etc.) |
| `ai_providers.json` | AI provider configuration list |
| `tasks/` | AI conversation storage (one subdirectory per conversation, containing metadata, messages, settings) |

## Auto Update Mechanism

Lumin uses GitHub Releases as its distribution channel:

1. **Version Detection** — Fetches latest release info from GitHub API on startup and in Settings
2. **Semantic Comparison** — `compareVersions()` compares local vs. latest version
3. **Asset Matching** — Auto-selects the correct `.exe` (portable or installer) for the current edition
4. **Secure Download** — HTTPS enforced, real-time progress pushed to frontend
5. **Integrity Check** — SHA256 verification against release checksum
6. **Hot Swap & Restart** — Replaces executable and auto-restarts on success

> Version management: `wails.json` (build), `frontend/src/config.js` (frontend), `frontend/package.json` (npm) — all three stay in sync.

---

## Settings Panel

Lumin provides a comprehensive settings panel organized in tabs:

| Tab | Features |
|-----|----------|

## Important Notes

### Security
- **AES Key Backup** — `lumin.key` is your master key. If lost, all encrypted data (passwords, private keys) becomes unrecoverable. Back it up.
- **WebSocket Authentication** — Terminal WebSocket connections use a random 32-byte token with strict Origin header validation (`wails://wails`), preventing unauthorized local access.
- **Host Key Verification** — Always verify the host key fingerprint on first connection. Lumin detects key changes to protect against MITM attacks.

### Operations
- **Single Instance** — Lumin enforces single-instance mode. Double-launching re-activates the existing window instead of opening a new one.
- **Window Close Behavior** — Set your preferred close action in Settings → General. Options: ask each time, quit directly, or minimize to tray.
- **Sync Conflict** — When syncing across devices, the auto-merge strategy handles conflicts. Review the sync mode in Settings → Sync & Cloud.

### MCP / AI Integration
- **Service Toggle** — MCP service is off by default; enable on demand in AI panel settings
- **Browser Call Control** — Control whether browser requests with an Origin header can access the local MCP service
- **Fixed Local Port** — The MCP server binds to `127.0.0.1:5779`. Ensure this port is not occupied by other services.
- **Local Only** — The MCP server only listens on localhost, so AI editors must run on the same machine.

## FAQ

### How are passwords/keys encrypted?

A 32-byte random AES key is generated on first run and stored in `lumin.key`. All passwords, private keys, and credentials are AES-256-GCM encrypted before disk writes.

### How do I sync configs across machines?

Settings → Sync & Cloud → configure any backend (WebDAV / R2 / FTP / SFTP). Lumin auto-encrypts and snapshots every config change. Configure the same backend on the new machine and restore.

### Does server cloning copy passwords?

Yes. Cloning uses the backend API to fetch the real decrypted password/key data. The cloned server has all configuration (passwords, keys, credential references) identical to the original.

### What's the difference between credentials and inline auth?

Credentials extract authentication into reusable entities linked to multiple servers. Editing a credential automatically updates all referencing servers. Ideal for managing multiple servers with the same auth.

### How does the AI agent (MCP) integration work?

Lumin has a built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, off by default and toggleable in AI panel settings. When enabled, it listens on `127.0.0.1:5779`. AI editors (Windsurf, Cursor, Copilot, etc.) connect via standard MCP client configuration. AI can read terminal output and execute commands. Browser call access and terminal output limits are also configurable.

### Which platforms are supported?

Windows, macOS, and Linux — all three platforms are supported with native builds fully tested.

### How do I configure window close behavior?

Settings → General → "When Closing Window" offers three options:
- **Ask each time** — Dialog asking quit or minimize to tray
- **Quit directly** — Close immediately exits the app
- **Minimize to tray** — Close minimizes to system tray
